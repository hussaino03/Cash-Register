# Cash-Register
Logging Of Transactions With Taxes 

## Functionality 

- A Cash Register that accepts 5 values, and prompts the user to type out uppercase or lowercase h before or after the value to include the item value in HST tax. 
- The max amount that a user can enter is below $1000 and a positive number, otherwise it would not be included in the totals. 
- After the user types 5 values, the item values are stored in different arrays. 
- One of them is for HST values only, and the other one is for non-HST values only. 
- 15% tax is then applied to HST values only, and then accordingly, a new item total is provided. A summary total, HST total, and Amount Due is also provided in the end.
